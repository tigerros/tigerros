~~Go to [norussian.tk](https://norussian.tk) to DoS Russian websites! 🇺🇦❤️~~ This doesn't work anymore. You need to download the `index.html` file from the repository below.

If you want to verify that it is not a scam, go to [ajax-lives/NoRussian](https://github.com/ajax-lives/NoRussian). [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajax-lives/NoRussian/main/index.html) is the raw HTML that you can run locally.
